Wanted to take advantage of the pathfinding algo of the adv. minibot. 
Wanted to optimize the puzzle to get coins faster.
Did not focus on main spim bot movement. Ended up making it turn an increasing angle on every bonk.

Originally wanted to spawn as many adv minibots as possible, but managing all of them was difficult.
Additionally, the puzzle optimization was not very significiant in the end.

However, as long as we qualified and kept the silo in a safe enough place, we though our simpbot is competitive enough to 
place decently well.

If we had more time, we would concentrate on the puzzle more.
